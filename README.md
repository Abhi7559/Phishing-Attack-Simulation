# Phishing-Attack-Simulation

Phishing Attack Simulation
This project is a simple simulation designed to demonstrate how phishing attacks work for educational and awareness purposes only. It shows how attackers can create deceptive login pages to trick users into providing sensitive information like usernames and passwords.

⚠️ Disclaimer:
This project is intended solely for educational purposes and to help individuals and organizations recognize phishing threats. Do not use this code for any malicious activities. Misuse can lead to legal consequences.

Features
Fake login page that mimics a real website (example: Facebook, Gmail, etc.)

Captures submitted username and password

Saves the credentials into a secure file for demonstration

Lightweight and easy to deploy locally or on a server

Basic anti-bot protection (optional)

Tech Stack
HTML/CSS (Frontend design)

java (Backend handling)

JavaScript (for basic client-side validation)

How It Works
User is directed to the fake login page.

Upon entering credentials, data is captured and stored securely.

The user can be redirected to the real website afterward to minimize suspicion.

Usage
Clone the repository

Set up on a local server (XAMPP, WAMP, or any Python-based server)

Access the login page via localhost or your server IP
